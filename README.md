## 📖 About

**AniHub** is a front-end streaming platform concept inspired by Netflix, redesigned with an anime identity. Rather than cloning the original experience 1:1, this project gives it a unique personality — its own branding, color scheme, and feel — as if it were a real standalone service dedicated to anime and related content.

The project was built as a portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in semantic HTML, modular JavaScript (ES Modules), CSS architecture, and user experience design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a pure front-end project with no build step required, getting it running locally is straightforward.

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RicardoLF1914/anihub.git
cd anihub
```

**2. Serve the project**

Because the project uses ES Modules (`type="module"`), it must be served over HTTP — simply opening `index.html` directly in a browser won't work.

You can use any local server. For example, with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VS Code extension, right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

Or via the terminal with Python:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **Color Palette** — `#00B84D` (AniHub Green) replaces the classic Netflix red, giving the platform its own identity while keeping the familiar dark background (`#141414`).
- **Component Architecture** — JavaScript is split into small, single-responsibility modules (`Card.js`, `Carousel.js`, `utils.js`) to keep the codebase maintainable and scalable without a framework.
- **Theme System** — The `ThemeManager` class listens for both manual toggles and OS-level `prefers-color-scheme` changes, ensuring a consistent experience.
